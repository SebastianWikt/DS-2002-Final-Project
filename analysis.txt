After retrieving data from the given API once every minute for 60 minutes, I was able to gather
data about the columns factor, pi, and time. Although the time wasn't perfectly every minute, I
was able to get it very close to gathering data every minute. To accomplish this, I implemented
a simple for loop that used the requests library to take it data and put it in my SQL database,
which I connected to locally. I utilized the sleep() function in order to gather data every 60
seconds from the API to support my findings of correlations between the columns.

After I inputted my findings into a database, I queried it based on the pi value in increasing order 
to see the correlation. My findings showed that when there as even factors increased, the pi column 
got closer to the true value of pi from the less than the true value of pi side. Accordingly, as the
odd factors increased, the pi column got closer to the true value of pi but from the greater than side
 of the true value of pi. Additionally after querying through all of the data, I found that as the time
 increased and went on, the factors increased with it.
