After retrieving data from the given API once every minute for 60 minutes, I was able to gather
data about the columns factor, pi, and time. Although the time wasn't perfectly every minute, I
was able to get it very close to gathering data every minute. After I inputted my findings into a
database, I queried it based on the pi value in increasing order to see the correlation. My findings
showed that when there as even factors increased, the pi column got closer to the true value of pi from
the less than the true value of pi side. Accordingly, as the odd factors increased, the pi column got closer to the true
value of pi but from the greater than side of the true value of pi. Additionally after querying
through all of the data, I found that as the time increased and went on, the factors increased with it.
